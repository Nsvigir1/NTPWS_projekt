        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <img src="img/JS.png" alt="JS" />
        <p>
          JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is
          high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
          curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
          object-orientation, and first-class functions.

        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
        <img src="img/CSS.png" alt="CSS" />
        <p>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
          describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
          such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
          alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        <h2>HyperText Markup Language</h2>
        <img src="img/HTML.png" alt="HTML" />
        <p>
          The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language
          for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be
          assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
          scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <h2>TypeScript</h2>
        <img src="img/TS.png" alt="TS" />
        <p>
          TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by
          Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds
          optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the
          development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[5]
          As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript
          programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

        <h2>JAVA</h2>
        <img src="img/JAVA.png" alt="JAVA" />
        <p>
          Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
          language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
          as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to
          let programmers write once, run anywhere.
